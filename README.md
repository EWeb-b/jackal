## App overview - Recipezy

Our app aims to take the hassle out of shopping for recipes. The annoying task
of finding recipes at home then aggregating a shopping list without forgetting
anything need not be so annoyng. The app will use an image text detection API
to extract text from photos of recipes, we will then format this data into a
shopping list of ingredients and store it in a database. A user will be able to
sign up to our app and snap all of their favourite recipes automatically creating
and storing the ingredients as a shopping list. They will then be able to select
a collection of these recipes with a create shopping list function; this will
aggregate all of the ingredients into one formatted data structure suitable to
send to a supermarket/online grocery API which will add the items to the users
cart ready to place the order for it to be delivered.
