## App overview - Recipezy

Our app aims to take the hassle out of shopping for recipes. The annoying task
of finding recipes at home then aggregating a shopping list without forgetting
anything need not be so annoyng. The app will use an image text detection API
to extract text from photos of recipes, we will then format this data into a
shopping list of ingredients and store it in a database. A user will be able to
sign up to our app and snap all of their favourite recipes automatically creating
and storing the ingredients as a list. EDIT: The recipe ingredients can then be 
passed to our Nutrition calculator, which will use a nutrition API to calculate
the nutritional breakdown of the recipe.



(ORIGINAL):The ingredients originally would have been able to be added to
a list suitable to send to a supermarket/online grocery API which will add 
the items to the userscart ready to place the order for it to be delivered.
Unfortunately the Tesco API had been disabled due to COVID-19 and no other UK 
supermarkets offer a free functional API.
